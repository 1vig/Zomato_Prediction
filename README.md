# Zomato_Prediction
Zomato Dataset Analysis and Price Prediction This project aims to predict the price of food for two people using the Zomato dataset. The dataset includes various features such as restaurant name, location, cuisine, ratings, and more, which are used to build a predictive model.


## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure and distribution of the data, and identify key features that influence the price of food for two.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that could improve the predictive power of the model.
- **Model Building**: Develop and train machine learning models to predict the price of food for two.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and refine them for better accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to showcase the insights and results of the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Zomato, a popular restaurant aggregator and food delivery platform. It contains information on various restaurants, including:
- Restaurant name
- Location
- Cuisine type
- Average cost for two
- Ratings
- Number of reviews
- Other relevant features

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis, model building, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/1vig/Zomato_prediction.git
    cd Zomato_prediction
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks** to explore the data, build models, and visualize results:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Results

The project demonstrates the process of predicting the average cost for two people dining at a restaurant using machine learning models. The results include:
- Data visualizations that highlight trends and insights from the dataset.
- Trained models with performance metrics.
- A detailed analysis of the factors affecting the price of food for two.
